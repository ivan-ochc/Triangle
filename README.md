It is an application that returns 6 numbers that describe 3 corners of right angled triangle in the Cartesian coordinate system. There is one method that returns right triangle.
This application contains some Junit tests. These Junit tests were created according to the test task. These tests check whether the triangle is right.

You can use following values to test application:

1)x1=0,y1=0,x2=3,y2=3,x3=3,y3=0; 
Expected result: tests should successfully pass, triangle is right.

2)x1=0,y1=0,x2=3,y2=3,x3=0,y3=0;
Expected result: tests should fail, this geometrical figure isn't triangle at all

3)x1=0,y1=0,x2=3,y2=3,x3=4,y3=0;
Expected result: tests should fail, triangle isn't right
