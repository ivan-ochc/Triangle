It is an application that returns 6 numbers that describe 3 corners of right angled triangle in the Cartesian coordinate system. It contains a method to create a right angled triangle and some built-in Junit tests, built to check whether triangle is right angled. The tests were created according to a test task.

You can use following values to test application:
 
1)x1=0,y1=0,x2=3,y2=3,x3=3,y3=0;  
Expected result: tests should successfully pass, triangle is right.

2)x1=0,y1=0,x2=3,y2=3,x3=0,y3=0;  
Expected result: tests should fail, this geometrical figure isn't triangle at all

3)x1=0,y1=0,x2=3,y2=3,x3=4,y3=0;  
Expected result: tests should fail, triangle isn't right
